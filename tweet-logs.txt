1/6 🥋 **Durden vs. Van Deep Dive: Striking Metrics**  
Joshua Van brings *insane* volume to UFC 310 with 8.39 strikes/min & 53% accuracy, dwarfing Cody Durden's 3.35 strikes/min (50% acc). Van also outlands opponents by +2.30 strikes/min vs Durden's +0.04. With better striking defense (58% vs 50%), Van dominates the standup game! 🥊💥 #UFC #FightGenie  

---

2/6 🤼‍♂️ **Grappling Breakdown: Durden's Wrestling Edge?**  
Cody Durden’s wrestling is elite: 4.36 takedowns/15min with 50% accuracy. But Joshua Van boasts an *impressive* 83% takedown defense, making it tough for Durden to implement his ground game. If Durden can't secure top control, he's in trouble standing! ⚔️ #UFC310 #FightGenie  

---

3/6 📏 **Physical Stats & Style Clash**  
Durden’s southpaw stance gives him a unique angle, but Van’s orthodox style has held strong so far. At 5’7 with a 67” reach, Durden has slight advantages over the shorter Van (5’5, 65” reach). Can he use this to close the gap in striking volume? 🤔 #MMAStats #UFC  

---

4/6 🔍 **Style Matchup & Strategy**  
Van’s high-volume striking pairs perfectly with his takedown defense (83%), making him a nightmare for wrestlers like Durden. Durden MUST pressure early with his grappling or risk being picked apart on the feet by Van’s relentless pace and precision! ⏳🥊 #UFCAnalysis
